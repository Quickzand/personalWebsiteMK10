I wanted to make sure I utilized this unique benefit when developing Gizmo, so customization was always at the forefront of my mind. Every action can be attached to unique input methods, such as a button, toggle, knob, or dragger. Much work was done to ensure that these input methods were intuitive and easy to use, so that the user could quickly and easily set up their actions with any kind of input. Each kind of input can be styled to look however a user may like, and can be placed and resized anywhere on their screens."
